# Music API

A RESTful music API that I created with Express.js and connected up to a PostgreSQL database.

The API manages data from various endpoints and is hosted on Render. The PostgreSQL database was first created using Postbird and then hosted on Supabase.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-api.git
cd music-api
npm install
```

## Running the server

`node app.js`
